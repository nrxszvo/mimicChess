# mimicChess
## a nueral network chess bot trained in the style of an LLM to predict human-like chess moves

mimicChess is built with [Pytorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai) and leverages the [Lichess database](https://database.lichess.org) to train a transformer neural net with approximately 1 billion parameters on over 100 million chess games between human opponents.

See the [mimicChess demo site](https://chessbot.michaelhorgan.me) to learn more about how mimicChess was built and to watch mimicChess in action.
