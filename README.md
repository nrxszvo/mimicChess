# mimicChess

## A Neural Network Chess Bot Trained in the Style of an LLM to Predict Human-like Chess Moves

**mimicChess** is built with [Pytorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai) and utilizes the [Lichess database](https://database.lichess.org) to train a **transformer neural network** with approximately **1 billion parameters** on over **100 million chess games** between human opponents.
